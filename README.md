## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This was a HTML/CSS/Git Challenge: The skill is to apply advanced CSS with HTML
- The motivation was make a responsive site that resembled the mock-up
- I built this project to reinforce skills in HTML & Advanced CSS & and to gain extra practice pushing to GitHub and resolving any merge issues
- I had trouble early on with turning my desktop landing page to a responsive mobile page. 
  I resolved this my researching how to use flex and grid designs simultaneously.
  Ultimately I used grid template for the desktop page and flex-direction column for the mobile.
- I learned how to apply transitions,linear gradients, box-shadows, I learned about scroll-behavior to make smooth scrolling transitions from nav to anchors on the same page.
- I learned how to create overlay effects for divs, this can be seen over the app thumbnails
